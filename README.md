## 🧠 Protocol Architecture: Sovereign Stack Overview

```

  GOV[NexaraGov]
  ID[LumID]
  CTRL[NexAscend CLI]
  GUI[Ascend GUI]
  TRACE[NexChain]
  AUTO[Microtask Engine]
  DOCS[Documentation Hub]

  GOV --> CTRL
  ID --> CTRL
  CTRL --> GUI
  CTRL --> TRACE
  CTRL --> AUTO
  CTRL --> DOCS
```

🔺 **NexAscend CLI** is the central controller coordinating all layers  
🔒 **Gov & ID layers** define policy and trust  
📡 **Trace, GUI, Docs, and Automation** are the modular outputs

### ⚙️ Vision & Principles

At the core of this ecosystem lies [NexAscend](https://github.com/mj-nexara/nexascend)—an ethical invocation framework designed to:

- Ensure **modular transparency** for cloud-based control systems
- Uphold **sovereignty of identity and action** through projects like LumID and NexaraGov
- Promote community-driven innovation aligned with **trust, resilience, and decentralization**
